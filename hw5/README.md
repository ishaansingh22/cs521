# HW 5: VQA and SynCode Problems

- **Problem 1 (SynCode)**: Implementation of a mathematical expression parser using SynCode to extract floating-point operands and operators from natural language queries, with Python computation.

- **Problem 2 (VQA)**: Neural architecture implementation for Visual Question Answering (VQA) trained on the Balanced binary VQA dataset, with validation results and example predictions.

- **Problem 3 (LLM-VQA)**: Evaluation of multimodal LLM performance on complementary VQA pairs using GPT-4o via ChatGPT, with analysis of correct/incorrect predictions.

- **Bonus**: Extended VQA system with LIME explanations for both image and text features to interpret model predictions.

## Note
Solutions are implemented in Google Colab notebooks with detailed evaluation metrics and examples.
